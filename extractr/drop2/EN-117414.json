(2) Due to the restrictions the plaintiff placed on trading in the accounts at issue, covered call option writing was one of the only investment strategies Mr. Collette could pursue in an attempt to reduce the plaintiff's risk from lack of diversification. Mr. Collette explained the investment strategy and Plaintiff signed multiple attestations representing that he understood the risks involved with pursuing options strategies. (3) Mr. Collette was transparent with Plaintiff regarding the profits he made. Overall, Plaintiff's portfolio was profitable, but Plaintiff made significant withdrawals from the accounts at issue, then claimed it was unprofitable. Mr. Collette was confident that the case was fully defensible and would have prevailed had the case gone to trial. Ultimately, the insurance company made a business decision to settle, as it was less expensive than trying the case.
